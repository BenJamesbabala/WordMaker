WordMaker

Makes randomly generated words based on character n-grams.

Currently this file just functions as my to-do list:

* If model is changed, add a warning informing user to re-build model before generating new words
* Have a page that explains the word lists and provides sources
* Refactor
    * Make CSS classes and IDs all consistent
    * Eventually move Markov Model code to its own file
