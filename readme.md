WordMaker

Makes randomly generated words based on character n-grams.

This project is built using the following:
* Bootstrap 4 alpha for the responsive design and pretty components
* jQuery to read the input fields and make the buttons do stuff
* Plain JavaScript to do the actual word-making, nothing special about it

I am also using this as my to-do list:

* If model is changed, add a warning informing user to re-build model before generating new words
* Refactor
    * Make CSS classes and IDs all consistent
